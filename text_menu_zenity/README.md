# Description
- the script uses the infinite while loop with `zenity` terminal utility to display a selection menu with different functions
- temporary files are used for storing the output of the commands located in functions (df, who...) so they can be displayed in the info box
- the second temporary file temp2 is used for storing the selection value from the main menu
- clicking the cancel button of the main menu exits the script (via exit status 1)
